**GameWorld**

This project is here to showcase my javascript full stack skill set.

My goal is to make a website where people can play games against AI that I'm developing using ML techniques.

As of now the websites skeleton and basic functionality is up. I am currently working on adding games.

The game Cups is set up in the backend and am now working on allowing people to play against each other on the frontend.

Games to Come: Tictactoe, Connect4

Todo: Still need to add unit tests.
